      <h2>How hard is it to become a pharmacist?</h2>
    
    
      <p>
        No, it is not hard if you know your stuff. However, if you do not know what you are doing or learning on the job it is very hard you may want to quit. All other healthcare professionals rely on pharmacist’s expertise for medications recommendation. A pharmacist is required to know the indications, effectiveness, safety, and compliance education for all medications. In a very busy clinical setting, you have very little time to look these things up. You need to have them on your fingertips. One more thing before you make medication recommendations, you are required to check the patient’s whole profile, drug allergies, vitals, medical conditions history, past medications history, current medications/supplements/minerals history, social/sex/economic history, occupational history, religious beliefs, drug-drug interactions, drug-food interactions, evaluation of clinical labs, and even insurance information-can the patient afford the medication you are about to recommend. All this information should be integrated in a few minutes. The longer you delay the longer the treatment delays. This is very critical when it comes to emergency medical attention.

The pharmacist is the to-go-to person when doctors and nurses want information about the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drugs. You will always get calls asking to recommend the best route, best formulation, IV to PO conversions, best-med delivery device, and IV compatibility questions, etc.
